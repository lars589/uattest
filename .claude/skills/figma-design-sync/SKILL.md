  Round-trip the UI design system with Figma — push tokens and surfaces, then land a designer's edit back as code. Not otb-figma-sync, which is pixel-art tiles only. Triggers: "sync design to Figma", "push tokens to Figma", "pull my Figma edit into code", "figma round-trip".

  Keeps the project's design style and a Figma file in step: sends the style to Figma, and turns a designer's edit there back into the project.

  When a designer works in Figma and their changes should reach the project.

  Uses your session and your Figma access. Bringing an edit back changes the project's files.

You are helping the builder run the Figma round-trip loop for the `ui` discipline's design surfaces: push the repo's current tokens/surfaces into Figma so a designer always starts from real state, then bring a designer's Figma edit back into the repo as committed-ready code.

## What this skill does

1. **Import (push)** — `bongos exec scripts/gds/figma-design-sync.js` (a thin shim over `modules/ui-design/scripts/figma-design-sync.js`, the module home — ADR 0197) builds a push plan (`figma-plan.json`: color-swatch frame, typography-specimen frame, one reference frame per surface) in a temp directory and prints a JSON manifest.
2. **Push** — the live Figma MCP tool (`mcp__figma__*` write capability, or `use_figma`) creates/updates the frames described in the plan inside the target Figma file. If write capability isn't available in this session, stop and surface the gap — do not fake the push.
3. **Export (handoff)** — when a designer finishes a Figma edit, hand its output to `adapter.export()`.

## How to use

### Step 1 — Build the push plan

```bash
bongos exec scripts/gds/figma-design-sync.js
```

To limit to one surface:
```bash
bongos exec scripts/gds/figma-design-sync.js --surface <id>
```

### Step 2 — Push to Figma

Use the live Figma MCP tool to realize each frame in `figma-plan.json` as real nodes (rectangles for swatches, text nodes for typography specimens). Confirm the target Figma file with the builder before writing — never assume which file.

### Step 3 — Receive the designer's edit (export)

Figma hands back one of two shapes, depending on whether Code Connect is wired for the component:

**Code Connect output (ready code — the common case):**
```js
const adapter = require('./modules/ui-design/adapters/figma/index.js');
await adapter.export({
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  surfaceId: '<surface-id>',
  toolOutput: { files: [{ path: 'Card.js', content: '...' }] },
  taskId: '<gds-task-id>',
});
```

**Raw Figma MCP node snapshot (no Code Connect mapping yet):**
```js
await adapter.export({
  repoRoot: process.cwd(),
  surfaceId: '<surface-id>',
  toolOutput: { snapshot: { nodes: [/* Figma node objects */] } },
  taskId: '<gds-task-id>',
});
```

The adapter translates simple frames/text/solid-fill rectangles into code. A node with an image or vector fill (icons, illustrations, freeform art) comes back as a `warnings[]` entry telling you to export it as an asset under `assets/ui/<surfaceId>/` instead — it is never silently dropped, and never forced into code it can't honestly represent.

## Fidelity limit (be upfront about this)

Round-trip fidelity is limited to what Code Connect or the Figma MCP can extract (ADR 0081). Arbitrary canvas art (icons, illustrations, freeform vector work) becomes a committed asset, not round-tripped code — that is the honest cost of the human escape hatch, not a bug.

## Code-canonical vs. Figma-canonical

Code-canonical is the default: the repo is authoritative, Figma is a synced view. A surface may be flagged `"figmaCanonical": true` in `config/design-sources.json` as an explicit exception (modules/ui-design/docs/design-contract.md §3.4) — only do this when the builder explicitly asks for a surface a designer actively iterates on in Figma.

## Path safety

The export step enforces path safety: no file (or translated snapshot node) may escape `src/ui/<surfaceId>/` or `assets/ui/<surfaceId>/`. A path-escape attempt throws before any write.

## After using this skill

- New `config/design-sources.json` entries from `export()` should be committed alongside any generated UI code.
- Run `bongos exec scripts/gds/validate-design.js` after touching adapters or design-sources — it's wired into `scripts/gds/fitness.js` as a hard-fail once any adapter is present.
- This is the UI-surface loop (ADR 0081). For pixel-art tile review in the example Figma file, use `otb-figma-sync` instead — the two skills never touch the same Figma file or the same directories.
